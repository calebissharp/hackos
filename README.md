# hackos
A hacking game played through SSH.

## Playing the Game
To play this game, you need to have an SSH client installed

Once you are connected, enter your credentials. If your username is not taken, you will create a new account with the password you supply. If you have alread made an account, entering the same password will bring you back to where you left off.

Just follow the instructions, and see how far you can get!

### Windows
If you are using Windows, your best option would be to use [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html)

For the host option, enter `hackos.calebissharp.com`, and for the port, enter `8022`. Then hit `Open`.
You will be prompted by a window that will say `login as:`. You can pick any name you want. Do the same for the password.

### Linux
Just use this command
```
ssh your-name@hackos.calebissharp.com -p 8022
```
