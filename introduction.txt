Your name is Detective Frank Oliver of the LAPD Cyber Forensics Unit. You're currently the lead detective on a case to track down the notorious hacker Oddity.

You return home one night, extra intent on finding your target. You log onto your laptop, and begin the search. You already have a lead, a Barbara Nelson, who was Oddity's most recent victim in a string of attacks. Going through her machine, you found a trace back to an IP. Now you must follow that IP all the way to the top and stop Oddity from causing anymore damage.
